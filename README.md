# Social Card App
A small application that basically mocks a social media post such as a Facebook or Twitter post.

## What's so great about that?
Well, it was made in React so everything renders almost instantly. You can like the post, share and even comment on the post. The changes do not stay or save to any sort of database but the point of this application was to show the usefullness of React rendering.
